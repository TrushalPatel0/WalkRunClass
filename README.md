# **Walk Run Classification**
-----------------------------

## **Business Case-Study**

This project is based on Human motion analysis and activity recognition using wearable watch/sensors, which help to us to classify human activities (either walking or running) based on sensor data collection from wearable devices. We will apply different Machine learning algorithm including: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XG-Boosting and Artificial Neural Network.

-----------
## **Dataset Description**

This Dataset consists Total of 10 Features and 1 Target(activity).

1) Date	: The calendar date on which an activity was recorded.

2) Time	: The specific time of day when an activity was recorded.

3) Username	: The identifier associated with the individual wearing the wristwatch.

4) Wrist :  Indicates the wrist (left or right) on which the wristwatch is worn.

5) Activity : The type of activity being performed (0 for walking/1 for running).

6) Acceleration_x	: Acceleration along the x-axis measured by the wristwatch's accelerometer.

7) Acceleration_y	: Acceleration along the y-axis measured by the wristwatch's accelerometer.

8) Acceleration_z	: Acceleration along the z-axis measured by the wristwatch's accelerometer.

9) Gyro_x	: Angular velocity around the x-axis measured by the wristwatch's gyroscope.

10) Gyro_y : Angular velocity around the y-axis measured by the wristwatch's gyroscope.

11)	Gyro_z : Angular velocity around the z-axis measured by the wristwatch's gyroscope.

## **Challenges faced**:

We have to analyse EDA part with respect to acceleration_x, acceleration_y, acceleration_z, gyro_x, gyro_y and gyro_z and have to understand its relation with respect to wrist and activity.
